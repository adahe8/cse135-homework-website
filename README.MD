## Third Party Analytics Free Choice Platform (Part 3.3)
We chose to set up monitoring with Simple Analytics for our 3rd analytics platform. We were compelled by its commitment to user privacy, its reported ease of use, efficiency, and its cost effectiveness. Compared to Google Analytics and LogRocket, the user interface is more minimal and therefore easier to learn, and will not assign cookies to users of the sites they analyze, making it more privacy-forward. However, this means it also has a lot less detail. The central dashboard predominantly tracks user activity through visualizations. Location positioning is general, and user information is not as invasive or specific as LogRocket, as we do not keep profiles of user information that is not intentionally disclosed, nor save visual recordings of their actions. It is quite easy to customize user events to track using client-side javascript, but again, limited information is recorded. Overall, it seems that Simple Analytics is a great alternative  for static sites and smaller web projects, like blogs and personal portfolios, where the full functionality of more thorough and invasive analytics platforms are not necessary.
